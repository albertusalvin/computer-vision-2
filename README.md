# Assignment 2: Voxel-Based 3D Reconstruction

- Code is in `main.py`
- Reference to the code from Assignment 1 is in `assignment1.py`. I take the parts that I need and wrap it in functions, as can be seen in `main.py`.
- Supporting utility functions (such as opening XML file or sampling video frames) are in `util.py`
- `corner_finder1.py` and `corner_finder2.py` contain the code for manual interpolation.
- The `data` folder that contains the videos, and the code for visualizing 3D voxels, are not committed here. Please download separately.

Feel free to suggest better ways to structure and make it more readable.
